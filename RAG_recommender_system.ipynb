        "### Review Retrieval Logic\n",
        "\n",
        "For the recommendations by the content-based model:\n",
        "- Retrieve reviews that are semantically relevant to the user’s query.\n",
        "- From these relevant reviews, select those with high combined helpfulness scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the recommendations by other (NeuMF Sbert, ibcf, relatedfallback)\n",
        "- Retrieve reviews by directly selecting those with high combined helpfulness scores, without semantic filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logic for combined score can be found under reviews preprocessing file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Business Rationale\n",
        "\n",
        "Since content-based recommendations are directly linked to the user’s search query, it is important that the retrieved reviews are aligned with the specific needs expressed in the query. By prioritizing semantic relevance first, we ensure that the explanations generated by the LLM adequately capture and address the user’s intent.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, recommendations by other models are not contingent on the users queries (they are driven are driven by factors like historical user interaction patterns instead). In this case, reviews that have been marked as helpful by other users are sufficient indicators of quality and relevance. High helpfulness scores symbolize collective user agreement on the review’s usefulness, making them appropriate inputs to generate trustworthy explanations."
